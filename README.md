# Smart-Laser-Based-Face-Detection-Using-Open-CV
This project describes a simple and effective system that can detect and follow faces using a camera and an Arduino. The camera captures live video, and a software called OpenCV finds faces in the video. The Arduino controls two small motors that move to keep the camera and a laser pointer aimed at the detected face.
